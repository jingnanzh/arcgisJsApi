  <title>ArcGIS API for JavaScript Tutorials: Add layers to a map </title>
  <h2>Add feature layers in a 2D map:</h2>
  <pre>

    Applications can access and display feature layers that are hosted onArcGIS OnlineorArcGIS Enterprise.
    A hosted feature layer contains features (records) with a geometry and a set of attributes.
    Each hosted feature layer has a REST endpoint with a unique URL.
    A FeatureLayer class can use the URL to access and draw the point, line, or polygon features in a map.
    If properties such as the renderer or pop-up have not been pre-defined for the hosted feature layer, the map will use default symbols and pop-ups will not be enabled.

    To learn how to enhance the visualization and behavior of feature layers, visit the Style feature layers, Configure pop-ups, and Filter a feature layer tutorials.
